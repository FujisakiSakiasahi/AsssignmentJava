10/2/2021 - repo created
11/2/2022 - jhunkit created Player.java class
11/2/2022 - riaru fixed it :D

12/2/2022
- riaru made a temp ui to create a player (as a test)
- added a function to print all player details
- jhunkit added clear screen and system pause for print all player details function

- note: made a new discovery, if making a new function that can get input, pass in the scanner and not make a new one. This is because making a new scanner will buffer the original scanner. (took me like an hour)
