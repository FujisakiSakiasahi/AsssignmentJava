#To-do
<1>
You and your team should design the program with at least 2 classes (one class for the
objects and another class as driver class which contain main method). Draw a class
diagram for designing the program.
Your system should be able to insert, delete, and update the records.

<2>
Build an interactive graphical user interface program by using Java that can perform the
operations that you have in Assignment 1. You have to write the codes from scratch. No
code generation by using drag and drop functions from any IDE.

12/2/2022
- riaru made a temp ui to create a player (as a test)
- added a function to print all player details
- jhunkit added clear screen and system pause for print all player details function

- note: made a new discovery, if making a new function that can get input, pass in the scanner and not make a new one. This is because making a new scanner will buffer the original scanner. (took me like an hour)

- jhunkit added clearscreen function and pause function.
